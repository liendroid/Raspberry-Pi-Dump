Bully Tunes is a fun musical instrutment to teach kids how to make music while having fun doing so. 
Who doesn't wanna play with squishy soft things?

At first we looked at pyqt to create and design our gui, however, we quickly learnt that Tkinter
was a better option.

Example code that we used to understand how to use the library. It’s actually the code that
introduced us to the library as well. We found it using google.

Tutorial from sowmya. The output program eventually died on us and we had to go back to the
adafruit program for testing, but the cirtcuit diagram was super helpful.

Which eventually bothered us so much that we jumped ship and went to pygame. Pygame was a
lot more fluid and easier to use in terms of GUIs and threading. Or in the case of pygame,
channels.

We did still need to learn how to use threading in our time with sonic pi/python pi, so this
resource helped us understand how to use it.

This was a great example as to how to integrate GUI elements into pygame.

We lived in the pygame documentation.
